# ClicK.E

This repo contains to branches: the main branch has code used on the Arduino Uno that is responsible for the ultrasonic sensor and the matrix row switching of the actual keypad while the leonardo branch contains code used on the Arduino Leonardo that interfaces with the computer by taking in the key-pad matrix signals as inputs.

### Code Compilation

To run the code on this repo, download the two branches separately and simply compile and upload the code to the Arduino Uno / Leonardo. All external libraries have been included as a local file and should be able to execute locally once downloaded.
